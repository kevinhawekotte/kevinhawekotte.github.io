I was going through a painful divorce at the time, I figured physical pain would distract me from the emotional turmoil. It did. I like running because you can do it anywhere. More recently I’ve tried running on trails which is a lot of fun for me."

I sustained injuries while running and swimming provides a nice way for me to get the rush I got while running. I enjoy swimming because I can spend an hour and a half in the water and it feels as if time has stood still. I like the feeling of being weightless, and not having to use my senses the way I have to on land. Swimming makes me feel free, and that is exactly why I like it."

I had a bike when I was a kid and any time I get on a bike I feel like a kid again. I don’t bike as much as I swim or run, but I really enjoy doing it.\nLooking at my hobbies, I suppose that they could be summed up in just 1 : exercising. I don’t feel as if I’m “good” at any of those activities, I just enjoy them. It’s been nice to see my personal progress over the years in each of them. I’ll never be a professional athlete, but I’ll always be trying to beat my previous times/distances/speeds. That’s fun for me."
